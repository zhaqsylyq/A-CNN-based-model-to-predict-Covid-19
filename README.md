# A-CNN-based-model-to-predict-Covid-19
A CNN‑based model to predict Covid‑19

Implemented my own CNN model that is able to classify a given lung x‑ray image as ”normal” or ”pneumonia” or ”covid” with an accuracy of
87%
• To improve the accuracy, implemented transfer learning by using the pre‑trained VGG16 model
• By optimizing the parameters such as learning rate, batch size and by using the EarlyStopping callback technique I was able to improve the
accuracy to 90.3%
• Technical Skills: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, sklearn, Tensorflow, keras.
• Soft Skills: Presentation Skills, Report Writing.
